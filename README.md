# Insta-OCR

This repository contains a small example script that demonstrates how an OCR
workflow could be invoked from the command line. The `src/main.py` entry point
accepts the path to an image and prints a message indicating that OCR would be
performed.

```bash
python src/main.py path/to/image.png
```

Actual OCR functionality is not yet implemented.
